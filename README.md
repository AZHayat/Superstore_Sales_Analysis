# Superstore Sales Data Analysis 📊
Welcome to the Superstore Sales Data Analysis project! This portfolio showcases a comprehensive exploration of the Superstore sales dataset, focusing on key performance indicators and actionable insights to drive business strategy.

## Key Analysis Areas 🚀
### Sales per Product 🛍️
We dive into the top-selling products based on total quantity sold. While staples dominate the market, we recommend focusing promotions on products ranked 2-10 to maximize overall revenue growth.

### Profit by Category 💰
Here, we evaluate total sales and profits across various categories and sub-categories. Notably, furniture and labels require targeted marketing efforts to boost their performance.

### Churn Analysis 🔄
This section identifies products with high return rates and calculates their return percentages, enabling us to pinpoint problematic products and reduce losses.

### Geographic Sales Analysis 🌎
We compare sales and profits across regions, emphasizing the need for improved performance in the underperforming Canadian market.

### Sales Trends Over Time 📈
This analysis tracks monthly sales trends, revealing peak performance during November-December and dips in January-February. Strategic campaigns can leverage these insights to boost sales in slower periods.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
We calculate CLTV based on average sales, purchase frequency, and customer lifetime, identifying high-value customers for targeted retention strategies.

### RFM Segmentation 📊
Our final analysis segments customers into categories such as “Champion,” “Loyal Customers,” and “At Risk.” This helps us focus efforts on retaining top customers while re-engaging those at risk of churn.
